# water-wave-text
This repository contains code and assets to create a water wave text effect using HTML and CSS. The effect utilizes the `clip-path` property to create a wave-like shape that appears as if it's flowing through the text.

To customize the water wave text effect, you can modify the CSS variables defined in the :root selector of the CSS file (style.css). The following variables are available for customization: <br>
:root {
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--background-color1: #416f9a;            /* First background color of the page */
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--background-color2: #6DFC6B;            /* Second background color of the page */
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--animation-time: 4s;                     /* Duration of the wave animation */
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--water-color: #03a9f4;                   /* Color of the water wave */
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--second-water-color: #33d6d1;            /* Secondary color of the water wave */
